# Cursor Rules - Nebula API Client

## Code Quality
- Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
- Prefer small, composable components over large monoliths.
- Keep business logic in services/hooks; keep UI components presentational.
- Avoid duplicate styles; reuse shared UI primitives in `src/shared/components/ui`.

## UI/UX Consistency
- Use theme tokens (`ctp-*`) instead of hard-coded colors.
- Preserve the glass + Catppuccin-inspired aesthetic.
- Ensure accessible focus states and keyboard navigation.
- Favor semantic HTML and clear hierarchy in layouts.

## Testing & Tooling
- Add or update tests for new logic (Vitest).
- Keep lint and type-check clean (Biome + TypeScript).
- Remove unused code and props when refactoring.
